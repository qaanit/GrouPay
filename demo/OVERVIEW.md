# Project Overview

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Name
``` c
GrouPay
```

## ðŸš€ Summary
``` c
An app designed to streamline the painful process of group payments. Easily add members to a payment, add items to each members bill, and track each members payments. Allows for quick, easy, no fuss group payments.
```

## âœ¨ Key Features
``` c
- Add items and their prices, and add members
- Add items to each members bill, and track their total to be paid
- Generates unique links for each member to allow for online payment to the host
- Shows progress of total bill to be paid
```

## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration
``` c
After playing five-a-side football for a few years, I know the hassle of handling group payments. Its difficult to keep track of who owes who, who needs what change, and who still needs to pay, and at the end their still seems to be too little for the bill. I designed this app with that problem in mind and how quick and easy it would be to sort out money if it could be tracked and paid through one app.
```

## ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements
``` c
- Take a picture of the bill and items are added automatically instead of adding them individually
- Allow splitting of items if two or more shared
- Allow members to 'owe' the host if they cannot pay now
```
